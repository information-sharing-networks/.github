# Information Sharing Networks

## [About](#about)

We are a collaborative alliance across government, industry and academia working on the Ecosystem of Trust initiative. These designs, protocols, implementations and governance frameworks are a reusable part of the EoT work.

## [Introduction](#introduction)

Almost every business or organisation generates or consumes [events](glossary.md#event) in the course of it's day to day activities. These businesses collaborate with others that share a common domain of interest but the value in this collaboration tends to be low and the friction is high. Organisations are silos, the technical and governance means by which data is (over)shared are bespoke, inextensible and duplicative. The default information sharing approach in industry and across regulatory authorites at this time favours the sharing of raw data. This increases duplication in the storage of data and the processing over it and raises the barrier to entry in information sharing forcing consumers to make sense of the data and increasing the chance of semantics leaking over the boundaries of large numbers of organisations.

Identity and information assurance are two examples of where the value in inter organisational collaboration is evidently very high. One of the key uses of assurance is in forming conclusions on 'trustability'.

## [Vision](#vision)

We have a shared vision of developing a repeatable toolkit to build configurable, scalable, sustainable and privacy enabled networks (or ecosystems) for participants who share common domains of interest and are motivated to share intelligently generated insight in the form of [signals](glossary.md#signal) about those domains, but who want neither to share a common information infrastructure nor to rely on fragile point-to-point messaging structures. This toolkit will be model, standard and technology agnostic.

## [Objectives](#objectives)

- join expertise across organisations and individuals participating in mutually beneficial ecosystems to improve decision making and business processes close to real time at an ecosystemic level
- give control to participants over how and when they contribute their insight and expertise and what is done with it by others
- minimise data - reducing duplication in the administration and storage of and inference over information
- maximise local processing - to help remove unnecessary intermediaries, centralisation and data lakes
- provide more scalable and extensible alternatives to the current friction filled share mechanisms and instruments
- reduce the impact of IT on the environment

## [Components](#components)

To realise our objectives we are building an open, scalable, extensible, repeatable, sustainable and privacy enabled information sharing network toolkit.
