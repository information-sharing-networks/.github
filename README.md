# Information Sharing Networks

# About

We are a collaborative alliance across government, industry and academia.

# Vision

We have a shared vision of developing a repeatable toolkit to build configurable, scalable, sustainable and privacy enabled networks (or ecosystems) for participants who share common domains of interest and are motivated to share insight/signals about those domains, but who want neither to share a common information infrastructure nor to rely on fragile point-to-point messaging structures.

# Objectives

- join expertise across organisations and individuals participating in mutually beneficial ecosystems to improve decision making and business processes close to real time at an ecosystemic level
- give control to participants over how and when they contribute their insight and expertise and what is done with it by others
- minimise data - reducing duplication in the administration and storage of and inference over information
- maximise local processing - to help remove unnecessary middlemen, centralisation and data lakes
- provide more scalable and extensible alternatives to the current friction filled share mechanisms and instruments
- reduce the impact of IT on the environment

# Components

To realise our objectives we are building an open, scalable, extensible, repeatable and sustainable information sharing toolkit.
