# Getting started
This project is public and can be read by anyone.  If you want to contribute you will need to register for github.  If you want to change the documentation then you will to let someone on the EOT tech team know what your username is so that they can add you to the project.  

Github is primarily used to help software developers manage their projects and, although we will be using a couple of tools provided on github to collect ideas and contributions, some of the features will be primarily of interest to technical uses (for instance developers often use it to help manage the different versions of their software - you can read about how Government Digital Services do that [here](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2014/01/27/how-we-use-github/).

The features we will mainly be using are:

* The github Editor to capture project documentation - this can be used in a browser (see below)
* Github [Discussions](https://github.com/information-sharing-networks/.github/discussions) will be used for discussions.
* if we create any technical documentation we'll look at using [github Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY) to create a website.

There is a separate [project](https://github.com/ecosystem-of-trust-interoperability) run by the Ecosystem of Trust team used to collect data related to the EOT Interoperability Working group.  This project is not visible to the public - please contact one of the EOT team if you would like to join.

# Editing documents
All the documents are editable in the browser.  The documents are formatted using a simple syntax called *Markdown*.  For instance you can show some text in italics by surrounding it by asterixes ```*italicised text*```. You only need to know a handful of markdown rules to format most documents.  See [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for details.

Click the pencil icon at the top right of the document title to start editing.  When you have finished editing you can use the "commit" button and include a short description of the changes you made.

If you are not a member you are welcome to submit a pull request containing your suggested changes. 

# Discussions
Use the [Discussions](https://github.com/information-sharing-networks/.github/discussions) tab to create new discussions.  Anyone with a github account can contribute.

# Things you should not share
This is a public website and some things should not be shared here (e.g account credentials, unreleased policy)
Although this [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed) was written for software developers, the same principles apply here.
