# Glossary

## About

An industry, trade expert, standards body and government collaborative glossary of terms.

N.B. This glossary does not defined terms from specific domains - it defines terms for the build blocks of a domain agonstic information sharing network capability.

## Terms

### [Event](#event)

**Typical definitions**

> Noun: 'something that happens or is regarded as happening; an occurrence, especially one of some importance'

**Context**

- Events are generated and consumed in endless different domains in systems or the physical world
- There are many ways to capture them digitally, or to represent and transmit them to potentially interested Event Consumers
- Events provide a useful mechanism for auditing
- Events based designs raise the level of abstraction
- Event based designs permit a shared understanding of how a system works without intimate knowledge of internal design

### [Signal](#signal)

**Typical definitions**

> Noun: 'anything agreed upon or understood as the occasion for concerted action'

> Adjective: 'unusual; notable; outstanding'

> Verb: 'to communicate or make known by a signal'

> 'The fundamental quantity of representing some information'.

**Context**

- [Events](#event) are represented as signals to make them accessible via shared (distributed) messaging infrastructure
- Signals permit organisations to minimise information share volume while maximising the sharing of expertise
- Signals are typically self contained - they usually do not require additional out of band information to be made available
- Signals reduce the need for complex ontologies and reduce semantics leaking over boundaries due to heir more precise/targetted deisgn and footprint
- The inherent properties in signals permit consuming parties to make their own minds up on whether and how to use them for example whether aggregation or corroboration are necessary
- Signals may move bi-directionally between any number of entities participating in a network
- There is low friction/effort in representing an event as a signal
- A signal may represent part of an event, multiple events or the result of any processing over information or events
- A signal is typically not a large footprint of raw information
- A signal is typically:
  - An attribute of an event or information element
  - A verified attribute of an event or information element
  - An opinion based on observation of information or events
  - A claim based on analysis of information or events
  - Insight generated by the deployment of expertise over data or events
- A signal may be comprised of several elements and is described in more detail in the [protocol](https://github.com/information-sharing-networks/signals)
