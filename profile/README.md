Information Sharing Networks (ISNs) allow organisations to securly exchange information in the form of signals.
Signals are simple messages that conform to an agreed specification and allow for replies or contributions, enhancing the shared information by accumulating endorsements, corrections, opinions and so on.

The network sharing infrastructure is very lightweigt and is designed so that data is held securly and can only be viewed by authorized participants. New networks and the associated infrastructure can be set up in minutes.


## Reference implementations
The initial implementation can be found in the [isn-ref-impl](https://github.com/information-sharing-networks/isn-ref-impl) repo.  Version 2 can be found in [signalsd](https://github.com/information-sharing-networks/signalsd)


# Information Sharing Network - Framework Agreement
To support the deployment of this type of a technology we have created a [Framework Agreement](https://github.com/information-sharing-networks/Framework) that allows information to be exchanged between groups of public and private orgnaisations with a shared interest or objective. 

The Framework Agreement makes it easier for organisations to cooperate by minimising the paperwork needed when a new information sharing requirement is identified.
